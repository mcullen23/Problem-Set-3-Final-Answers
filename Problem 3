#find greatest change in water levels

import pandas as pd #important, use pandas for this answer

file = "/ufrc/bsc4452/mcullen1/CO-OPS__8729108__wl.csv" #define file with data

data = pd.read_csv(file, usecols=[0,1]) #read csv and keep only data/time and water levels, columns 0 and 1

data.columns = data.columns.str.strip() #enables sorting of data by getting rid of whitespaces

data.columns = data.columns.str.strip().str.replace(' ', '_') #replaces blank spaces between words in labels with underscore

data['Diff'] = data.Water_Level.diff() #new value with the calculated differences between level waters in one column and the water level in the previous column

sorted_data = data.sort_values(by=['Diff'], ascending = False) #creates a new dataset with water level differences sorted from highest to lowest

check = sorted_data.head(5) #checkpoint to make sure the shorting of the differences worked

answer3 = sorted_data.head(1) #shows difference value from top line, along with correponding date

print('Accuracy Guarantee...')
